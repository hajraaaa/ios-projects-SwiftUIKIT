# Image Collection App

This iOS application demonstrates a simple pattern for managing a collection of images using a `UICollectionView`. The app features a custom cell with an "Add Image" button that allows users to upload images from their gallery or camera. The layout is configured programmatically to provide a dynamic and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Collection View**: Displays a grid of images using a `UICollectionView`.
- **Custom Cell**: Each cell includes an `UIImageView` and an "Add Image" button.
- **Image Selection**: Clicking the "Add Image" button presents an action sheet for selecting an image from the gallery or camera.
- **Dynamic Layout**: The "Add Image" button cell moves to the end of the collection view after an image is added.
- **Custom Layout Configuration**: The collection view's layout is set up programmatically, including manual configuration of button attributes and values.

## How It Works

- **Collection View**: Displays a grid of images with one cell dedicated to the "Add Image" button.
- **Custom Cell**: The `CustomCell` class contains an `UIImageView` and a UIButton configured to add images.
- **Image Selection**: The "Add Image" button opens an action sheet allowing users to choose between the gallery or camera. Selected images are added to the collection view.
- **Dynamic Layout**: After adding an image, the "Add Image" button cell moves to the end of the collection view. The layout is configured programmatically to handle this dynamic behavior.
- **Custom Layout**: The collection viewâ€™s layout, including item size, spacing, and section insets, is set up programmatically, allowing for precise control over cell positioning and appearance.
